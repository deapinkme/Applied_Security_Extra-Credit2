How it works:

For each password in the password list
    Try to login via HTTP request

The HTTP request for the login page has its own URL.
After successful login:
    - Either the response redirects to a success page (response status code 302)
    - Or the response contains some string indicating success

For different sites this program has to be tuned as follows:
- Change POST to GET request if the site does not accept it
- Change success_code to failure_code as some sites, for example return 401 status code
  upon login failure
- Change the success_substring to failure_substring if we know that the login failure response
  contains a specific substring
